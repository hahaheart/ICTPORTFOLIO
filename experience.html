        <h1>ICT EXPERIENCE</h1>
        <p class="experience-p1"> When I first encountered coding in this subject, I thought it would be hard, I thought that it would be too complex for my understanding and that it would be very difficult for me to study the lessons. But as I tried to learn the basics, it slowly became very easy. In fact, it even became fun. When I first started coding, it felt like I was entering a completely new world. There were so many terms and concepts to grasp—variables, loops, conditionals—and it all seemed overwhelming at first. But as I spent more time with the code, it started to make sense. It was like learning a new language, and each piece I understood opened up a bit more of the landscape. </p>

<p class="experience-p1"> One of the most exciting parts of coding is problem-solving. There's nothing quite like the feeling of finally fixing a stubborn bug or finding a solution to a complex problem. It can be challenging, of course—sometimes I’d spend hours trying to track down a single error—but when I solved it, it was like hitting the jackpot. It made all the effort worth it. I also found that coding allowed me to be creative. Whether I was building a small script to automate a boring task or developing a more complex application, I could see my ideas come to life. I loved that I could create something from scratch and then watch it work, knowing I had built it with my own hands. That sense of accomplishment was incredibly rewarding. But coding wasn’t always easy. There were times when I felt frustrated, especially when I couldn’t figure out why something wasn’t working. It tested my patience, and there were moments when I felt like giving up. In those times, I learned the importance of persistence. I found that if I just kept at it, trying different approaches and asking for help when needed, I could usually find a solution. It was a lesson in resilience. </p>

<p class="experience-p1"> It can be hard to keep up, but I’ve come to enjoy the challenge. There's always something new to explore, and it keeps things interesting. In the end, coding has been a journey filled with creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and continuous learning. It has its highs and lows, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. It’s given me the tools to create, innovate, and contribute to something bigger, and that’s a pretty amazing feeling. </p>
